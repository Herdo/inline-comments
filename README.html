<h1>Inline Comments by <a href="http://kevinw.de/">Kevin Weber</a></h1>

<p>Inline Comments is a WordPress plugin that adds the great Disqus Comment System to the side of paragraphs and other specific sections (like headlines and images) of your post. You can download it from the official WordPress directory: http://wordpress.org/plugins/inline-comments/</p>

<p>The comment area is shown when you click the comment count bubbles (left or right) beside any section.</p>

<p>Inline Comments is a further development from inlineDisqussions, a jQuery plugin by Tsachi Shlidor.</p>

<p>You can see a demo at tsi.github.io/inlineDisqussions (not a WordPress demo).</p>
